## Computing Option Implied Risk Neutral Distribution

Interpolated and extrapolated the volatility smile data using a cubic spline function that is “clamped” at the endpoints to avoid processing-induced violations of no-arbitragerestrictions, and created a python code that followed a simple technique for computing RNDs given suitable implied volatility smile
